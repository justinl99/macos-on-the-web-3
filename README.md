# macOS on the web 3

This open source project aims to replicate some of the macOS(Monterey, at the time of writing)'s desktop experience on web, using Svelte, based on [Puru Vj - macOS Web](https://github.com/puruvj/macos-web)

## Try it here: [macos-on-the-web-3.com](https://macos-on-the-web-3.vercel.app/)

## Why

I've always been very fascinated with macOS, and have never owned a Mac/book. So I'm making the most beautiful aspect of macOS, its desktop, myself. For web. Inspired from [WinXP](https://winxp.now.sh/).

## Stack

- Framework - Svelte (Earlier Preact)
- Bundler - Vite, for super fast development.
- Component Library - None!!
- Styling Solution - SCSS.

# Can I contribute?
